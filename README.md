# Employee-Directory-App [WIP]

I built my version of the employee directory app in XCode 12.5 using iOS 14.5. When running the app, please use an iPhone 8 or above for best results. In this app, I focused more on architecture and data flow and less on UI, although I did try to retain a functional, clean UI that is pleasant to view. Additionally, I focused on the iPhone rather than the iPad.

There are no external dependencies or APIs, but I did borrow a portion of code from StackOverflow that is used to download the profile images from the JSON file. Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24231680/loading-downloading-image-from-url-on-swift (see top answer)
